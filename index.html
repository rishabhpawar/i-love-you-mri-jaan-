    <h1>I LOVE YOU</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      I may not be able to give you the world,<br />
  But I’ll grab for you whatever I can,<br />
  And I might not be able to do everything you ask,<br />
  But I will try more than any other man.<br />
  Perhaps I won’t live up to all of your hopes,<br />
  But I will strive with all of my might,<br />
  And maybe sometimes I will stumble and fall,<br />
  But I will always fix it and make everything all right.<br />
  I will make some mistakes along the way,<br />
  Perhaps I’ll even make you cry.<br />
  And maybe I won’t be able to give you all of your dreams,<br />
  But, I promise, I’ll be the first one in line to try.<br /></p>

  <hr class='line'>

<p>How is it that you are real?<br />
My dreams never created something like you.<br />
I still have to pinch myself,<br />
Because I’m amazed you are true.<br />
I always think of you, in my sleep, in my dreams,<br />
I always think of you, all night all day, hoping you’re alright,<br />
I always think of you,<br />
wishing that you were thinking of me too,<br />
every minute, every second of the day, I think of you,<br />
I really do, all because…. I love you.<br /></p>

  <hr class='line'>

<p>In Her Eyes,<br />
I saw what a thousand future holds,<br />
In Her eyes,<br />
There the sun rise,<br />
In Her Eyes,<br />
My day calls for joy,<br />
Welcoming whatever it is its got to offer.<br /></p>

  <hr class='line'>

<p>I dream of a woman clothed in white.<br />
She wears wings that shine with golden light.<br />
Her hair is fine like that of an olden wife.<br />
Her eyes hold a vision of the road of life.<br />
She whispers love through the winds.<br />
Then rivers of love flow to my heart and my spirit ascends.<br />
I grow embraced by heavenly heights.<br />
Then glow rays of warmth and light.<br />
I wait only for her touch of the purest.<br />
I fall to her holding of love, of spirit!<br />
We become one in loving presence together.<br />
In love, we come to heaven forever.<br />
Like two doves we sing and dance.<br />
Love of a queen and king.<br />
Love will forever last.<br /></p>

  <hr class='line'>

<p>No man will not notice the beauty in you<br />
It’s like you are an angel out of the blue<br />
Your face may not launch a thousand ships<br />
But it’s your heart and soul that are for keeps.<br />

  <hr class='line'>

<p>You mesmerize me with your innocent smile<br />
But it’s your eyes that had me there for a while<br />
How I wish everyone would appreciate<br />
The beauty in you which is never to hate.<br /></p>

  <hr class='line'>

<h2>The value of your love is worth more to me than anything else.</h2>
